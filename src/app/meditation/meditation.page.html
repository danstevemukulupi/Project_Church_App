<h1>What is christian  Meditation</h1>
 <ul>
   <li>
    Christian meditation is a biblical practice encouraged in both the Old and New Testament.
    Christian mediation helps reinforce the truth of God's Word in believers' hearts so that they remember it and live by it.
    The purpose of Christian meditation is to bring a believer into closer fellowship with God through a greater understanding of his Word and a deeper commitment to his will and his ways.
   </li>

   <li>
    Christian meditation involves relaxing or stilling the body and focusing the mind for a period of time while thinking carefully about the words of Scripture, the character and nature of God, or contemplating spiritual purposes. The emphasis is on developing a closer relationship with God through a fuller understanding of his Word, and a deeper commitment to following his will and his ways. Inner transformation, as well as an enhanced biblical perspective, clarity, and balance, are the desired outcomes of Christian meditation.

    Many Christians avoid meditation because of the non-biblical implications emphasized in other kinds of meditation. However, Scripture explicitly promotes meditating on God's Word day and night (Psalm 119:97; Psalm 119:148).

When Joshua assumed the role of leadership over Israel after the death of Moses, God gave him this instruction:


"Study this Book of Instruction continually. Meditate on it day and night so you will be sure to obey everything written in it. Only then will you prosper and succeed in all you do" (Joshua 1:8, NLT).
Meditation on the Word of God, according to this passage, is key to the believer's individual happiness before the Lord, as well as his success in life. 

The Psalms repeatedly tell us to "delight in the law of the Lord," and to "meditate on it day and night" (Psalm 1:2). Believers are urged to ponder all the works of God and meditate on his mighty deeds (Psalm 77:11). Psalm 119:15 says, "I will study your commandments and reflect on your ways" (NLT). And in Psalm 119:148, the psalmist stays awake "through the night, thinking about your promise" (NLT).


The Bible establishes Christian mediation as a part of our worship: "O God, we meditate on your unfailing love as we worship in your Temple." (Psalm 48:9, NLT) Thus, "delighting in" and celebrating the words of God are part of Christian mediation.

King David, who wrote many of the Psalms, reported that in times of trouble and distress, he would lie awake through the night thinking about God, and meditating on him (Psalm 63:6; 77:12; 143:5).

The New Testament puts equal emphasis on meditation for spiritual growth and personal contentment:

"And now, dear brothers and sisters, one final thing. Fix your thoughts on what is true, and honorable, and right, and pure, and lovely, and admirable. Think about things that are excellent and worthy of praise. Keep putting into practice all you learned and received from me—everything you heard from me and saw me doing. Then the God of peace will be with you" (Philippians 4:8–9, NLT).
Meditation is also a means of purifying our minds and hearts (James 4:8).

   <li>
    In Christianity, meditation and prayer go hand in hand. Practically speaking, part of prayer is taking biblical and spiritual truth and applying it to our daily lives. Paul told believers in the early church to "never stop praying" (1 Thessalonians 5:17).

    Christian meditation is an excellent way for believers to look to Jesus Christ for help and spend time in God's presence. Prayerful meditation is more powerful and effective than secular mindfulness techniques because prayer puts us in communication with the God of all peace: 
    
    "Don't worry about anything; instead, pray about everything. Tell God what you need, and thank him for all he has done. Then you will experience God's peace, which exceeds anything we can understand. His peace will guard your hearts and minds as you live in Christ Jesus" (Philippians 4:6–7, NLT, see also Matthew 6:25-34).
